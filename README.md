New Beginning
After having a conversation with a friend in the software development field, I've realized a hobby I once had in high school has the potential to impact so many people. Every project I embark on allows me to learn more, and in a field where there are constant changes, I feel as though I can utilize what I discover from those changes to improve my knowledge of code. 2018 is a year where I begin a journey that I will continue throughout the rest of my life. Enjoying something that I've realized is all around me.
